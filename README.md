# Project Background 
According to WHO (World Health Organization) : 
1. Poor working environments including discrimination and inequality, excessive workloads, low job control and job insecurity pose a risk to mental health.
2. 15% of working-age adults were estimated to have a mental disorder in 2019.
3. Globally, an estimated 12 billion working days are lost every year to depression and anxiety at a cost of US$ 1 trillion per year in lost productivity.

Risks to mental health at work can include:
1. under-use of skills or being under-skilled for work;
2. excessive workloads or work pace, understaffing;
3. long, unsocial or inflexible hours;
4. violence, harassment or bullying, discrimination, and exclusionâ€¦ etc

Decent work supports good mental health by providing:
1. A livelihood
2. A sense of confidence, purpose and achievement;
3. An opportunity for positive relationships and inclusion in a community; and
4. A platform for structured routines, among many other benefits.


# Purpose 
To find out and predict the probability for someone or especially patient that predicted has problem with their mental health or not according to the causing factors. 

There are a lot of steps to find and predict the probability such as 
1. Data Visualization, to know the spread of the data in order to make the best decision 
2. Data Preprocessing, like normalization (in this case, using scaling is good idea for numerical data)
3. Label Encoding for categorical data (using one-hot encoding)
4. Hyperparameter tuning and models training for classification models on Machine Learning using Python programming language in Google Colab such as : 
   a. K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   b. Logistic Regression
   c. Random Forest
   d. Naive Bayes
   
In this project, we hope that we can evaluate the potential of model application for help many companies and workers to gain mutual benefits by starting the mental health in medical fields or even using real time data. 

It will help us to learn the implementation of the models and the impacts to support early diagnosis and  handling the mental health for all people especially for the workers to keep healthy in mental and productively.
